      <p>Hello! I'm a recent graduate from the University of Toronto with a passion for web development and technology. During my studies, I honed my skills in front-end and back-end development, building projects that showcase my ability to craft responsive, user-friendly web applications.

My technical expertise includes working with languages like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and frameworks like React and Node.js. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and stay updated with industry trends. Whether it's creating dynamic user interfaces or building full-stack applications, I love turning ideas into reality through code.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new tech, diving into design trends, or collaborating with other developers on exciting projects. I'm excited to start my journey as a web developer and continue growing in this ever-evolving field.</p>
